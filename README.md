# Loan-Applications
An Explorartory Data Analysis and a Linear Regression model on Loan Applications at a Bank.

The source of the dataset is from a companion page for Woolridge J. (2013). Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach.

Loan applications: loanapp.csv

The dataset contains data on loan applications to a bank, including various types of information on the applicant and the purpose of the loan, along with the eventual loan decision (approve or reject - see the column loan_decision).

The following analysis are done on the dataset - 
1. Loading a dataset from a CSV file.
2. Displaying descriptive statistics about the dataset.
3. Checking if any records in the data have any missing values; handle the missing data as appropriate.
4. Displaying the distribution of numerical variables as histograms.
5. Displaying unique values of a categorical variable.
6. Building a contingency table of two potentially related categorical variables. 
7. Conducting a statistical test of the independence between the variables. Provide verbal comments on the output.
8. Retrieving a subset of the data based on two or more criteria and present descriptive statistics on the subset.
9. Conduct a statistical test of the significance of the difference between the means of two subsets of the data.
10. Creating pivot tables.
11. Implementing a linear regression model and interpret its output.
